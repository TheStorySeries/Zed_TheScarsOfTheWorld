	<h1 class="story"><font class="fredrick">Fredrick (Yelling) :</font> Come on. Let's get together and get into this truck. We have to leave now. Take the guns with you.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="johnson">Johnson :</font> Yes, let's leave, Fredrick. All the people who managed to get into this truck will come with us.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="fredrick">Fredrick :</font> All right, let's go.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="johnson">Johnson :</font> Check all the ones who got into the truck; make sure nobody is missing. </h1>

	<h1 class="descrip">Johnson Hamilton is a 38-year-old man who is an energetic and brave person but could also be very rude and a bit impatient. He appears to be a fine-built, muscular man, black-haired and blue-eyed. Besides serving on a medical team in the military, he also worked as a medic in the field, so he had to venture into some of the most dangerous areas in search of the wounded. Over time, he had learned to take care of his injuries and had become a highlyskilled combat medic. At the age of 37, he resigned from the military to take care of his family.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="misc">Someone in the Truck :</font> Yes, sir. I checked all the people who came into the truck. Nobody is missing. We should leave this place as soon as possible.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="fredrick">Fredrick :</font> Where is Patrick, Johnson? I don't see him. </h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="fredrick">Fredrick :</font> We have to stay protected or else they will attack us. We should vacate this place as soon as possible</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="johnson">Johnson : </font> We should go to another place. It will be safer there. Ok, where do you suggest we go, Sir?</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> I understand Father.</h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">In the middle of the forest, it started to rain heavily. The rain was so dense that it became hard to see. In the middle of this forest, they saw a way which connected to a road and hoped that someone would rescue them in case.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="nelson">Nelson :</font> Oh, my leg...</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> What happened, Father?</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="nelson">Nelson :</font> No, nothing. You just run towards the road. I will follow you.</h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">Nelson was injured in his leg, and his leg began to spasm. Suddenly, he heard a quite loud growling sound, which was getting closer to him and getting louder. Piper shouts in the distance.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> Father, I found a car. </h1>

<!-- In the Car -->

	<u class="scene-under"><h1 class="scene-head">Inside the Car</h1></u>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> Come on, Wake up !!</h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">(Piper slapped the driver while nudging him awake. He woke up startled, then looked at Piper.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="misc">Driver :</font> Hey, what's wrong with you? </h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper (Crying):</font> Please help me, Uncle. Something chasing us.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="nelson">Nelson (In Pain) :</font> You leave this place Son !!</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> I don't want to leave, Dad.</h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">The driver and Piper watched with horror as Nelson was eaten alive by the horde of zombies. They couldn't do anything to save him. Piper started to cry hysterically.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="misc">Driver :</font> We need to leave this place now. </h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">The car was moving very fast, but the zombies were still able to keep up. One of them jumped onto the top of the car and started to try and bite the driver.</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="misc">Driver :</font>Just listen. Control the steering, Boy</h1>

	<h1 class="story"><font class="piper">Piper :</font> Okay, Sir</h1>

	<h1 class="narrator">The car accelerated at a high speed, but the zombies was still able to keep up. The driver leaned his head outside of the window and shot the zombie that was on top of the car. It fell from the car and did not move anymore. He controlled the car and then, hours later, the zombies were far away from them.</h1>
